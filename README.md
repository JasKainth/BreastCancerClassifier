# BreastCancerClassifier  


# Summary 

In this project, we will explore the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Original) Data Set, which can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Original%29). Our main objective will be to create a classifier to detect whether the cancer type is benign or malignant.  

An RMarkdown (.Rmd) file is provided along with a pdf file which is the result of knitting the .Rmd file. 

## breast_cancer_data.Rmd  

In this file, we will, very briefly, explored the data to see what is provided. There were no missing data nor data outside of the given range. Only the dependent variable (Class) needed to be re-coded, for convenience and the remaining attributes (possible predictors) were scaled on a scale of 1-10.
